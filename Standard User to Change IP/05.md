Yes, you can use `%USERNAME%` in the command to automatically add the **currently logged-in user** to the **"Network Configuration Operators"** group. Here's how:

### **Command to Add Current User to the Group**
```cmd
net localgroup "Network Configuration Operators" %USERNAME% /add
```

### **Important Notes:**
1. **Run as Administrator**  
   - This command **requires admin privileges**.  
   - Right-click **Command Prompt** → **Run as Administrator** before executing.

2. **No Quotes Needed for `%USERNAME%`**  
   - Since `%USERNAME%` never contains spaces, you **don’t need quotes** around it.

3. **Group Must Exist**  
   - Verify the group exists by running:  
     ```cmd
     net localgroup
     ```
     *(Look for **"Network Configuration Operators"** in the list.)*  
   - If it doesn’t exist, this command will fail (common in **Windows Home** editions).

4. **Changes Take Effect Immediately**  
   - The user must **log out and back in** or open a new **Command Prompt/PowerShell** session to apply permissions.

### **Full Example (Batch Script)**
If you want a reusable script:
```batch
@echo off
:: This script adds the current user to 'Network Configuration Operators'
:: Requires Admin rights!

net session >nul 2>&1 || (
    echo ERROR: This script must be run as Administrator.
    pause
    exit /b
)

net localgroup "Network Configuration Operators" %USERNAME% /add && (
    echo Success! %USERNAME% can now change IP settings.
    echo Log out and back in for changes to apply.
) || (
    echo FAILED. Possible reasons:
    echo - Group "Network Configuration Operators" doesn't exist.
    echo - You're not an Administrator.
)

pause
```
*(Save as `AddUserToNetGroup.bat` → Run as Admin.)*

### **Alternative for Windows Home Edition**
If the group doesn’t exist, use **Task Scheduler** (as discussed earlier) to allow IP changes without admin rights.
