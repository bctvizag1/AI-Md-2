No, you **do not need to restart the PC** after running:  
```cmd
net localgroup "Network Configuration Operators" "SDE OFC 001" /add
```

### **Why?**  
- **Group membership updates take effect immediately** for new logins or processes.  
- The user **"SDE OFC 001"** can now change IP settings **without admin rights** the next time they:  
  - **Log out and log back in**, or  
  - **Open a new Command Prompt/PowerShell window** (if they were already logged in).  

### **What to Do Next:**  
1. **Have the user log out and log back in** (or just open a new CMD/PowerShell window).  
2. **Test IP changes**:  
   - The user should now be able to run:  
     ```cmd
     netsh interface ip set address "Ethernet" static 192.168.1.100 255.255.255.0 192.168.1.1
     ```
     *(Replace `Ethernet` with the correct interface name from `netsh interface show interface`)*.  

### **When a Restart *Might* Help:**  
- If the user **still can’t change the IP**, try a restart to ensure all system processes recognize the new permissions.  
- This is rare but can happen with certain Windows configurations.  

### **Alternative if It Still Fails:**  
- Check **Group Policy** (if on Windows Pro/Enterprise):  
  ```cmd
  gpedit.msc
  ```  
  Navigate to:  
  ```
  Computer Configuration → Windows Settings → Security Settings → Local Policies → User Rights Assignment → "Change TCP/IP settings"
  ```  
  (Add the user or group if needed.)
