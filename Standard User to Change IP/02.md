The command you provided is **almost correct**, but there are a few things to check:

### **Corrected Command:**
```cmd
net localgroup "Network Configuration Operators" "SDE OFC OD1" /add
```
*(This adds the user `SDE OFC OD1` to the **Network Configuration Operators** group.)*

---

### **Possible Issues & Fixes:**
1. **Group Name Might Be Different**  
   - Some Windows versions (e.g., non-Pro/Enterprise) may not have this group.  
   - Verify the group exists by running:  
     ```cmd
     net localgroup
     ```
     *(Look for **"Network Configuration Operators"** in the list.)*

2. **Username Contains Spaces**  
   - If the username is `SDE OFC OD1` (with spaces), **keep the quotes** as you did.  
   - If the username has no spaces, remove quotes:  
     ```cmd
     net localgroup "Network Configuration Operators" username /add
     ```

3. **Run as Administrator**  
   - The command **requires Admin rights**. Open CMD as Administrator first.

4. **User/Group Doesn’t Exist**  
   - If you get **"The specified local group does not exist"**, your Windows edition may not support this group.  
   - Alternative: Use **`net localgroup administrators "SDE OFC OD1" /add`** *(but this gives full admin rights, which is **not recommended** for security).*

---

### **Final Check:**
✅ **If the group exists**, your command is correct.  
❌ **If the group doesn’t exist**, try:  
   - Using **Task Scheduler** (earlier method) to allow IP changes without admin rights.  
   - Upgrading to **Windows Pro/Enterprise** for `gpedit.msc` and proper group policies.
