To allow a **Standard User** to change the IP address in Windows, you can use **Group Policy (`gpedit.msc`)** to grant them the necessary permissions. However, since `gpedit.msc` is only available in **Windows Pro/Enterprise**, this method won't work on **Windows Home**.  

Here’s a **batch script** that automates the process of granting the Standard User permission to change the IP address by adding them to the **Network Configuration Operators** group (which allows modifying network settings without full admin rights).

### **Batch Script to Allow Standard User to Change IP Address**
```batch
@echo off
:: Batch script to allow a Standard User to change IP address
:: Must be run as Administrator

setlocal

:: Check if running as admin
net session >nul 2>&1
if %errorLevel% neq 0 (
    echo This script must be run as Administrator. Right-click and select "Run as administrator".
    pause
    exit /b
)

:: Set the username of the Standard User (change accordingly)
set "USERNAME=StandardUser"

:: Add user to "Network Configuration Operators" group
net localgroup "Network Configuration Operators" %USERNAME% /add

if %errorLevel% equ 0 (
    echo Success! %USERNAME% can now change IP settings.
) else (
    echo Failed to add %USERNAME% to the group. Check if the group exists.
)

pause
```

### **How This Works:**
1. **`Network Configuration Operators`** is a built-in Windows group that allows users to modify network settings (including IP) without full admin rights.
2. The script adds the **Standard User** to this group.
3. After running this script, the Standard User can change the IP via:
   - **Control Panel** (`ncpa.cpl` → Properties → IPv4)
   - **Command Prompt** (`netsh interface ip set address`)

---

### **Steps to Use:**
1. **Save the script** as `AllowIPChange.bat`.
2. **Right-click → Run as Administrator** (must be executed under the **Admin account**).
3. Enter the correct `StandardUser` name (replace with the actual username).
4. After running, the Standard User should now be able to modify IP settings.

### **Alternative (If "Network Configuration Operators" Doesn’t Exist)**
If the group isn't available (e.g., in Windows Home), you can instead:
- **Use `Task Scheduler`** (as in the previous method) to allow running a batch file that changes the IP.
- **Manually grant permissions** via `secpol.msc` (if available).
